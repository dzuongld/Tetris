## Version 1.0 

### Implemented features

- Basic block movements
- Audio
- Row clearance
- Default speed

### Known issues

- A bug regarding pressing "down" (S) button: Sometimes collision detection isn't fast enough and blocks simply go "through" the bottom, so this button should not be abused. It's best to leave the block dropping by itself, especially when it's about to hit the bottom or other dropped blocks.
- No support for scoring/leveling up/speed increase
- No grid layout

## Version 1.1

- Fixed issue of objects occasionally going through the bottom

## Version 1.2

- Improved controls

## Version 1.3

- Added support for arrow controls
