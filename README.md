# Tetris

## Description

- A Tetris clone built using Unity and C#
- Use A-D to move left and right, W to rotate, S to speed up
- Tested with Unity 2017.3
- EXE file included

## Version 1.0 

### Implemented features

- Basic block movements
- Audio
- Row clearance
- Default speed

### Known issues

- A bug regarding pressing "down" (S) button: Sometimes collision detection isn't fast enough and blocks simply go "through" the bottom, so this button should not be abused. It's best to leave the block dropping by itself, especially when it's about to hit the bottom or other dropped blocks.
- No support for scoring/leveling up/speed increase
- No grid layout

## Version 1.0 

- Fixed "dropping" issue
